description: |
  Fontra is an open-source, browser-based, cross-platform, variable-first
   font editor. Fontra extends the boundaries of what current font editors
   can do. Originally developed to make the design and production of large
   CJK fonts more efficient, Fontra provides deeper integration of 
   variable font technology and improved   usability of variable 
   components as design elements.
